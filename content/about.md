Online you can find me on:

<i data-feather="github"></i>
GitHub: https://github.com/paulbarbu, this is the place where you can find all the open-source code I have written.
I usually like to open-source my side-projects since I started learning to program by being part of an online
community based on an open-source book, to which I contributed myself eventually (https://github.com/yet-another-project).

<i data-feather="linkedin"></i>
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-gheorghe-barbu/, this is, if you want, my CV. It should be up-to-date at all times.
If something is wrong, please contact me about it.

<i data-feather="mail"></i>
The best way you can get in touch with me is via email: barbu.paul.gheorghe [at] gmail [dot] com
I'm open to project ideas, corrections or imprevements to whatever content I created online.

While offline, you can find me tending to other activities apart from programming, like running or DIY work around the house or
reading, since I try to avoid screens and sitting as much as possilbe after work.

<i data-feather="book-open"></i>
Lately I regularly volunteer at a local [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/) as a mentor in order to pass on some programming knowledge.
Learning is also a big part of my free time, keeping up with the latest developments in technology is pretty important in the field of programming.
