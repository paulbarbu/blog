Recently, at work, we held a software developemnt contest where, against my expectations almost all (good) solutions used an AI copilot of some sort.

Some contestants used it to optimize their code, while at the same time undertanding what the AI genearted. Some ... not so much: `fetch_add` has nothing to do with memory allocation and how the process handles allocations from than call forward! Read the fine manual, as they say...

T - horizontal part is increased vertical part is decreased - we think we know, we understand, but we don't. The process: matters.  We reach solutions faster, but with a cost - the cost of understanding and at the end of the line the cost of maintenance. There's tradeoffs.
