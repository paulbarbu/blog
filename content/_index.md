My name is Barbu Paul - Gheorghe,

Basically I'm a programmer, so the content of this blog will be technical in most cases.

The blog's main purpose is to serve as an archive of things I've encountered and found useful or things I struggled 
with for future reference or just random thoughts of mine that I feel the need to document and share on the web.

Feel free to [skim through my posts](/post) or to [read more about me](/about).
